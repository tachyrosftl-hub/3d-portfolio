# 3D Portfolio (Starter)

A starter Three.js scene with a rotating cube, starfield background, lights, and mouse-based camera movement. Built as a base for a high-end 3D portfolio.

## Tech
- Three.js (WebGL)
- HTML/CSS/JS (ES modules)
- No build step required for this basic version

## Files
- `index.html`
- `style.css`
- `main.js`
- `package.json` / `package-lock.json` (if you later add packages)

## Run
Open `index.html` in a browser (for local dev without server),
or use a simple static server:
```bash
npx serve .
